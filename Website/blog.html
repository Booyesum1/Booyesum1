    August 2005: Sergeant Major of the 23rd ASG

        This meeting was coordinated in a much different manner than usual. The sergeant major coordinated a date
    to have a training session with all of the NCO's in his command (this is usually mandated, not coordinated).
    It was the first of many examples that he meant to give on 'the evolving soldier and how to interact with 
    them.' In this meeting I would learn about the new generation of soldier entering the Army, what motivates 
    them, how to enact the motivation I desire from my soldiers to acomplish the mission I've been assigned, how to
    cary this knowledge forward to the units that I would be a part of in the future.
        To fully understand what happened in this meeting, I must convey the normative formality of most NCO
    training sessions.
